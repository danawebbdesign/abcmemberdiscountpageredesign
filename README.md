# abcmemberdiscountpageredesign
The ABC Member Discount page was in need of a redesign. I worked with my two coworkers to come up with a more user-friendly and visually appealing design for the page as around 5,000 people view the page every 3 months. After brainstorming, I moved to coding the site out in Dreamweaver. Once coded, I moved the code to DotNetNuke and adjusted from there. My coworkers and I met a few times after to make refinements to the page before releasing it live.

The finished page can be found at https://www.abc.org/Membership/Member-Discounts
